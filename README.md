Comcast Silicon Valley Web Developer
====================================

Welcome to the interview problem for Comcast Silicon Valley. The goal of this interview is to test your
skills as a front-end developer. The question should take no more than 2-3 hours to complete. We wish to
see how you write and structure a fairly simple single-paged HTML application.

General Guidelines
------------------

Follow general guidelines for how to successfully complete this interview:

1. DO NOT CLONE OR FORK THIS REPOSITORY
1. Use whatever client-side MVC framework you wish
1. DO NOT use a backend to generate different pages. This should be a single page.
1. Create a folder locally for doing your test
1. The HTML single-page application should be hosted at index.html.
1. The application should not require any executable. In other words, it should be able to run behind a static web server (like Apache HTTPD).
1. Download the [data.json](https://github.com/hallmark/testjsfiddleajax/blob/master/data.json) file
1. Use the data.json file DYNAMICALLY, not as an inline JavaScript object
1. Use whatever client-side MVC framework you want. If you don't know any, you may use jQuery to do DOM manipulation.
1. Create a ZIP file of your application
1. Send a ZIP file of the application to your recruiting contact at Comcast
1. You may assume that the interviewer is using a modern browser. Do not spend time now with IE compatibility.

Keep in mind that the developers checking your solution must be able to view your application by simply
unzipping the file into an Apache folder and opening your index.html file.

About the Application
---------------------

The application is intended to be a mockup for a help-like page for introducing external developers to
a set of JavaScript APIs. The user should be able to choose an API from the dropdown list in the upper
right hand corner and have it automatically update the body contents.

Expected Layout and Behavior
----------------------------

Below are example screenshots of the behavior and general layout we want to see. Exact pixel dimensions
and colors are not necessary but we do want to see most of layout. Use CSS to style your application
wherever possible.
